 * <li>1.<b>jdk based observer pattern</b>,java provides an inbuilt platform for
 * implementing Observer pattern through <code>java.util.Observable</code> class
 * and <code>java.util.Observer</code> interface. However, itâ€™s not widely used
 * because the implementation is really simple and most of the times we
 * customize my own interfaces and implement them,namely <b>customized observer
 * pattern</b>.
 * 
 * <li>2.<b>customized observer pattern</b>, we would implement a simple subejct
 * and observers can register to this subejct.
